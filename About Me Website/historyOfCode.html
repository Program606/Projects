        <h2>The rise of popularity of different Programming Languages</h2>
        
            <h3> A brief birth of Programming.</h3>

            Programming languages have a long and rich history, with the first recorded use of code dating back to the mid-1800s. 
            At that time, Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, 
            specifically Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. However, it wasn't until the 1950s that the first true programming languages 
            were developed, including Fortran and COBOL. These early languages were designed for scientific and business computing, 
            respectively, and set the foundation for the generations of programming languages that would follow.
            Over the years, programming languages have continued to evolve and advance in response to the changing needs of the computing 
            industry. From the 1960s to the 1980s, new languages such as BASIC, C, and Pascal emerged, each with its own unique features and 
            capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of the internet brought about the development of dynamic, web-based programming 
            languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, which made it possible for people to create interactive, dynamic websites and web 
            applications. Today, programming languages continue to evolve and expand, with new languages and tools being developed for 
            everything from artificial intelligence and machine learning to cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

        <h3>As time progressed... </h3>
        <p>
            Coding has become an essential skill in today's digital world. As technology continues to rapidly advance and permeate every aspect 
            of our lives, it is important to understand how it works and be able to create and adapt it to meet our needs. With the ability to 
            code, individuals can bring their ideas to life and develop innovative solutions to problems. Coding also opens up a vast array of 
            career opportunities in the tech industry, one of the fastest-growing and highest-paying industries globally.

            Adapting to technology is crucial in our rapidly changing world. By learning how to code, individuals can take control of technology 
            and not just be passive consumers. Coding literacy allows us to be more self-sufficient and independent in a world where technology 
            plays a significant role in our daily lives. It enables us to understand and make informed decisions about the technology we use and 
            its impact on our lives. Additionally, as technology continues to advance and shape the future, being proficient in coding will become 
            increasingly important for personal and professional development. In a rapidly changing technological landscape, those who are able to 
            adapt and innovate will be the ones who thrive.
