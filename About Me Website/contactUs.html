            The CodeCloset is the perfect guide for beginners looking to code. 
            We provide guides to common coding languages, as well as, more detailed
            support if you choose to contact us. Currently, the website is ran by the
            two of us, Kaydence Eng and Prince Manzano. You can see our lovely faces to the 
            right of the screen. You can hover the image to learn who's who (the crown should be a dead giveaway ;) ).
            Our websites not only serves as a guide for our users, but as a journal for the two
            of us as to share our coding journey.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>

        <p>  

            We began this website when we first started learning how to code.
            Many resources exist out there to guide beginners in their coding journey,
            yet it was spread out everywhere. That's where we come in. We wanted to make one 
            master site that anyone can refer to when they want to start coding. Helping 
            others with their coding is key to our site's mission, however, we also want to
            educate people on how code came to the place it's at today. Hence, we also 
            share knowledge regarding the history of code. Our site also provides 
            information surrounding the current atmopshere of the coding world such 
            as which languages are the most popular. Also, we found that a brief overview of the world of coding was 
            beneficial when we first started, so we offer the same when users first 
            visit our site. There are always people who are eager to code, but aren't 
            too sure what it might entail, so we also provide guidance in that regard.
            The CodeCloset in your one stop place for all coding beginners out there!
