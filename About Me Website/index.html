        <h2>Where do I start?</h2>
        
        <p><!-- Paragraph wrote using A.I: https://chat.openai.com/chat-->
            Starting to program can seem like a daunting task, but it's easier than you think. 
            The first step is to decide which programming language you want to learn. There are many 
            popular programming languages to choose from, such as Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript, 
            to name a few. Once you have chosen a language, there are numerous online resources that 
            can help you get started. Websites like Codecademy, Udemy, and Coursera offer interactive 
            tutorials, video lessons, and projects that can help you learn the basics and build your 
            skills. Additionally, you can find communities of like-minded individuals who are also 
            learning to code. These communities can provide support, guidance, and resources to 
            help you on your journey. Finally, it's important to practice what you have learned 
            by working on small projects and experimenting with different coding concepts. This 
            hands-on experience will help you gain confidence in your skills and prepare you for more 
            complex projects in the future. Remember, the key to becoming a good programmer is to stay 
            motivated and keep learning.

        <h2>Something you should consider...</h2>
        
        <p>
            <!-- Paragraph wrote using A.I: https://chat.openai.com/chat-->
            Programming is a challenging and rewarding field, but it's important to keep in mind 
            that it requires a significant investment of time, effort, and patience to become a 
            successful programmer. One of the most important things to consider while programming 
            is the concept of "debugging". Debugging refers to the process of finding and fixing errors 
            in your code. This can be a time-consuming and frustrating task, but it's an essential part 
            of the programming process and it helps you to become a better coder. Another important aspect 
            of programming is paying attention to detail. Small syntax errors or typos can cause big problems, 
            so it's important to double-check your code and make sure it's accurate. Additionally, it's crucial 
            to keep up with the latest developments in the tech industry, as well as continually expanding your 
            knowledge and skill set. Finally, it's important to have a growth mindset and embrace challenges as 
            opportunities to learn and improve. Coding is not an easy task, but with dedication, practice, and a 
            willingness to learn, anyone can become a successful programmer.

        <h2>A success story from us.</h2>

        <p> 
            <!-- Paragraph wrote using A.I: https://chat.openai.com/chat-->
            Prince and Kaydence, two BCIS students, started learning to code as part of their coursework and 
            quickly discovered their passion for programming. With hard work and dedication, they honed their skills
            and eventually landed internships at a tech startup. Their exceptional coding abilities and innovative 
            ideas caught the attention of tech industry leaders, and soon they were offered high-paying jobs at 
            major tech companies. Their success continued to grow, and before long, they were running their own 
            successful tech company, attracting investment from venture capitalists and making a significant 
            impact on the tech industry. They became known as two of the most brilliant coders in the business 
            and were soon being sought after for their expertise and innovative solutions. In recognition of 
            their achievements, Prince and Kaydence were invited to the White House to meet President Barack 
            Obama, who was impressed by their success story and eager to learn more about their innovative ideas 
            and solutions. This moment was a testament to their hard work and dedication, and it inspired others 
            to pursue their passions and never give up on their dreams.
